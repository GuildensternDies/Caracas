          <p>What is an Arepa?</p>
          <p>Itâ€™s a corn pancake, with savory or sweet fillings, rooted in Venezuelan tradition. At Caracas, our secret ingredient is consistency. We start with fresh ingredients and a love for the craft of creating the best Venezuelan food day in and day out. No matter where you come from, whether you are a part of the family or a first-time guest, you will feel the warmth of our dedication through the joy of our meals.  </p>
